# BMEK PCB v2.1

**Use at your own risk.**

- Contains some updates for the [separate plate case](https://github.com/Bemeier/bmek/blob/master/cases/highprofile_plate/)
- The PCB has been made and works. But it hasn't been tested with assembly yet, so please be double-critical when reviewing the Pick & Place positioning & components, in case you want to order this one assembled
- You most likely want to make v3 instead, it has several improved features such as ESD protection, multiple layout options and a nicer logo.
- Reasons to still be using this old version is that it combines hotswap and solder in a single design, and that it uses a more sturdy (but also more expensive) usb-c connector.
