# BMEK PCB v2.1

- Contains some updates for the [separate plate case](https://github.com/Bemeier/bmek/blob/master/cases/highprofile_plate/)
- The PCB has been made and works. But it hasn't been tested with assembly, so please be double-critical when reviewing the Pick & Place positioning & components, in case you want to order this one assembled!

## Version 3 is comming!

While v2.1 of the PCB  addressed some small changes to the PCB profile to make screws accessible in the plate design, there is a third version of the BMEK PCB in development with the following features:

- Separate design for hotswap and solder versions (to avoid the [potential interference issue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh93sXRh4x4&vl=en) with the previously south facing  option when using hotswap sockets)
- Layout option backspace: 2u Backspace and 2x 1u hhkb-like
- Layout option bottom row: The 2.75u spacebar can be replaced with a 2.25u spacebar for better keyset compatibility.
- ESD protection circuity
- Switched to the popular, cheaper and easier to hand-solder [HRO-TYPE-C-31-M-12](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/USB-Type-C_Korean-Hroparts-Elec-TYPE-C-31-M-12_C165948.html) USB-C receptacle
- Made completely from scratch in KiCad (project will be released as soon as design is verified)
