# BMEK PCB v2.1

- Contains some updates for the [separate plate case](https://github.com/Bemeier/bmek/blob/master/cases/highprofile_plate/)
- Not tested yet, but the changes were pretty small
- Note that on JLCPCB's previewer, the two circular cutouts in the center are not shown. Pretty sure this is due to their previewer, but definitely something to mention in the order notes.
