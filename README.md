# Hardware for BMEK - Bemeier Ergonomic Keyboard

![BMEK](https://i.imgur.com/3rHByZJ.jpg)


BMEK is an ergonomic keyboard in the spirit of [Lyn's EM7](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=83328.0) and [TGR Alice](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=95009.0).
Notable differences are the more [HHKB-like](https://www.hhkeyboard.com/) layout and the and the more symmetric looks due to the space bars and left key cluster arrangement.

## Layout

In the current version, only a HHKB-style layout ([KLE](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/ae301a4ba7e58ec17bfcf9b79da94a00)) is supported - no iso enter, no 2u spacebar for now.
Also note that you'll need 2x2.75 spacebars. Most GMK (spacebar) kits only come with one, but you can always use a shift key, or use a 2.25u spacebar and live with a little gap :)

## Firmware

Setup QMK and run `make bemeier/bmek:default`  

Source: [TODO: Release](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/bemeier/bmek), [Dev](https://github.com/Bemeier/qmk_firmware/tree/bemeier/keyboards/bemeier/bmek)

## PCB

Both hot-swap sockets and permanent soldering are supported. Connector is USB-C, and is confirmed to also work with USB-C to USB-C cables.

The PCB design was based on the schematics from the [Goldfish](https://github.com/Dr-Derivative/Goldfish) controller.

All Gerber & BOM files needed for ordering at JLCPCB are under [pcb/jlcpcb](https://github.com/Bemeier/bmek/tree/master/pcb/jlcpcb).
It can be ordered with pick-and-place assembly. SMD part costs from jlcpcb quotation (ordering 5 PCBs with pick & place).
Only top-mounted LEDs (optional), hot-swap sockets (optional) and USB-C connector need to be ordered separately and soldered by hand.
When ordering 5 boards (MOQ), the cost comes out to ~12$ per board, including assembly, but excluding USB-C connector and LEDs.

## Cases

3D models for a 2-piece high profile case with integrated plate mounts (intended for CNC-machining from polycarbonate & aluminium) are under [cases/highprofile](https://github.com/Bemeier/bmek/tree/master/cases/highprofile).
I'll also eventually release the entire Fusion360 project at a later point, as well as lasercut plate and case files ([cases/lasercut](https://github.com/Bemeier/bmek/tree/master/cases/lasercut)).

A top-mounted version of the original case is being designed under [cases/highprofile_plate](https://github.com/Bemeier/bmek/tree/master/cases/highprofile_plate), to be made from Aluminum soon:
